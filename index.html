        <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Matsuda. I'm currently a full time student at LearningFuze with hopes of becoming a
          sofware engineer/web developer in the future. Before LearningFuze, I had experience in both pre-sales and
          post-sales at a FinTech company. I started off doing client implementations where we helped
          many Fortune 500 companies get off the ground running with our platform. I then moved into a pre-sales solutions
          engineer role where I was able to demo and build out proof of concepts for prospective clients. It was here where
          my interest in software development began to build. I was able to see the positive reaction and impact technology
          had on not only indivdiual's lives but organizations as a whole. I thought to myself that instead of selling and
          implementing technology , I want to be behind the scenes building it.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I have a variety of interests ranging from watching sports to collecting watches to playing Super
          Smash Bros. I also enjoy traveling and checking out new coffee shops when I have the opportunity. </p>
